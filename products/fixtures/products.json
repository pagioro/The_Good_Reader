          "description":"Biography is one of the most popular, best-selling, and widely-read of literary genres. But why do certain people and historical events arouse so much interest? How can biographies be compared with history and works of fiction? Does a biography need to be true? Is it acceptable to omit or conceal things? Does the biographer need to personally know the subject? Must a biographer be subjective? In this Very Short Introduction Hermione Lee considers the cultural and historical background of different types of biographies, looking at the factors that affect biographers and whether there are different strategies, ethics, and principles required for writing about one person compared to another. She also considers contemporary biographical publications and considers what kind of 'lives' are the most popular and in demand. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.",

          "description":"John Aubrey's racy portraits of the great figures of 17th-centuryEngland stand alongside Pepys's diary as a vivid evocation of the period. Aubrey was born in 1626, the son of a Wiltshire squire; at the age of 26 he inherited a family estate encumbered with debt, and finally went bankrupt in the 1670s. From then on he led a sociable, rootless existence at the houses of friends - from Oxford and the Middle Temple -pursuing the antiquarian studies which had always obsessed him. At his death in 1697 he left a mass of notes and manuscripts, among them the material for Brief Lives. He never managed to put even a single life into logical order; all we have are the raw materials, scribbled down -`tumultuously as they occurred to my thoughts'. With this full, modern English edition, which reproduces Aubrey's words as closely as possible, Richard Barber introduces us to Aubrey and his world, tells how the Lives came into being and enables many new readers to enjoy this eccentric masterpiece.",

          "description":"Journey Across Time opens a window to life in South Asia, which has changed vastly since Susan Gillerman Boggs began living there as a diplomat's wife in 1985. In a captivating first-person narrative, Boggs takes the reader to remote places, many now closed to visitors. She describes experiences both exotic and hilarious, and adventures impossible to replicate. The author invites us to share the color and pageantry of festivals, religious rites, and parades of caparisoned elephants. She ventured into the Himalayas on perilous roads and was welcomed into a remote land of former headhunters. She dined with royalty and danced with a maharaja, conversed with Mother Teresa, met President Clinton, and appeared in a film starring Pierce Brosnan. She survived floods, political assassinations, and window-shattering bombs. She was bitten by a grouper in a coral lagoon, sneezed on by an elephant, and cornered in a cul-de-sac by angry bulls. Back on the home front, the author chronicles the daily joys and frustrations of diplomatic life with its cast of senior officials, moguls, intellectuals, and colorful characters. With verve and self-deprecating humor, she describes the tribulations of managing a diplomatic household and orchestrating official events despite personal dramas, logistic challenges, and power outages. Join her in a truly remarkable Journey Across Time.",

You'll take in Gio Ponti's colored geometries, Zaha Hadid's free-flowing futurism, the luminous interiors of SANAA, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh's unique blend of Scottish tradition and elegant japonisme. The book's A to Z entries also cover groups, movements, and styles to position these leading individual architects within broader building trends across time and geography, including International Style, Bauhaus, De Stijl, and much more.

          "description":"The path of an individual human life, our biography, is a kind of mystery. Despite the abundance of published biographies and autobiographies of celebrities and historical figures, scientific study of human biography remains in its infancy, with little understanding of the inherent laws in the path of an individual's life. Yet as Rudolf Steiner shows here, every biography--regardless of one's place in life or a person's perceived importance or success--is ruled by archetypal influences, patterns and laws. This broad-ranging anthology addresses critical and still-unanswered questions: What are the effects of education--especially contrasting educational methods--on later life? How are the stages of one's life interrelated? Do the effects of events on the individual become immediately evident, or is their true impact delayed, perhaps for decades? To what extent can we shape the stages of our individual biographies? How much freedom of choice do we have, and how much of life is predetermined? Drawing on his capacity for higher knowledge through spiritual research, Steiner describes the human individuality as a being with a continuing existence, both before birth and beyond death. Our eternal being experiences a myriad of conditions and situations, the effects of which may be observed in one's biography. This book addresses these and other issues such as freedom and destiny, the effects of heredity, illness, and the impact of education, offering answers based on a profound knowledge of the human being.",

          "description":"A brief magisterial introduction to the conservative tradition by one of Britain’s leading intellectuals. In Conservatism, Roger Scruton offers the reader an invitation into the world of political philosophy by explaining the history and evolution of the conservative movement over the centuries. With the clarity and authority of a gifted teacher, he discusses the ideology's perspective on civil society, the rule of law, freedom, morality, property, rights, and the role of the state. In a time when many claim that conservatives lack a unified intellectual belief system, this book makes a very strong case to the contrary, one that politically-minded readers will find compelling and refreshing. Scruton analyzes the origins and development of conservatism through the philosophies and thoughts of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith and Milton Friedman, among others. He shows how conservative ideas have influenced the political sector through the careers of a diverse cast of politicians, such as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Disraeli, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. He also takes a close look at the changing relationship between conservative politics, capitalism, and free markets in both the UK and the US. This clear, incisive guide is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand Western politics and policies, now and over the last three centuries.",

Yet this narrow view leaves many to question: How did Donald Trump win the presidency? And what is the future of the Republican Party? In The Right, Matthew Continetti gives a sweeping account of movement conservatism’s evolution, from the Progressive Era through the present. He tells the story of how conservatism began as networks of intellectuals, developing and institutionalizing a vision that grew over time, until they began to buckle under new pressures, resembling national populist movements. Drawing out the tensions between the desire for mainstream acceptance and the pull of extremism, Continetti argues that the more one studies conservatism’s past, the more one becomes convinced of its future. Deeply researched and brilliantly told, The Right is essential reading for anyone looking to understand American conservatism.",

          "description":"In The Soul of the World, renowned philosopher Roger Scruton defends the experience of the sacred against today's fashionable forms of atheism. He argues that our personal relationships, moral intuitions, and aesthetic judgments hint at a transcendent dimension that cannot be understood through the lens of science alone. To be fully alive―and to understand what we are―is to acknowledge the reality of sacred things. Rather than an argument for the existence of God, or a defense of the truth of religion, the book is an extended reflection on why a sense of the sacred is essential to human life―and what the final loss of the sacred would mean. In short, the book addresses the most important question of modernity: what is left of our aspirations after science has delivered its verdict about what we are? Drawing on art, architecture, music, and literature, Scruton suggests that the highest forms of human experience and expression tell the story of our religious need, and of our quest for the being who might answer it, and that this search for the sacred endows the world with a soul. Evolution cannot explain our conception of the sacred; neuroscience is irrelevant to our interpersonal relationships, which provide a model for our posture toward God; and scientific understanding has nothing to say about the experience of beauty, which provides a God’s-eye perspective on reality. Ultimately, a world without the sacred would be a completely different world―one in which we humans are not truly at home. Yet despite the shrinking place for the sacred in today’s world, Scruton says, the paths to transcendence remain open.",

          "description":"First published in 1980, The Meaning of Conservatism is now recognized as a major contribution to political thought, and the liveliest and most provocative modern statement of the traditional paleo-conservative position. Roger Scruton challenges those who would regard themselves as conservatives, and also their opponents. Conservatism, he argues, has little in common with liberalism, and is only tenuously related to the market economy, to monetarism, to free enterprise, or to capitalism. It involves neither hostility toward the state, not the desire to limit the state's obligation toward the citizen. Its conceptions of society, law, and citizenship regard the individual not as the premise but as the conclusion of politics. At the same time it is fundamentally opposed to the ethic of social justice, to equality of station, opportunity, income, and achievement, and to the attempt to bring major institutions of society - such as schools and universities - under government control. Its root conceptions are those of loyalty, allegiance, community, and tradition. The conservative vision of society is one in which autonomous institutions and private initiative predominate, and in which the law protects the shared values that bind the community together, rather than the rights of those who would blow the community apart.",

          "description":"Make it Healthy 1.Fresh, Fresh, Fresh. Eating fresh vegetables and fruits is always a goal when eating healthier. Fresh from the garden, the farmers' market or from the produce section of your favorite grocery store, choose ingredients that look fresh and colorful. Then enjoy them as soon as you can. 2.Eat uncluttered foods. Who needs to add canned sauces and gravies when a grilled piece of meat or roasted veggies taste so great? Keep food clean and simple whenever you can. 3.Read the label. If you don't know what an ingredient is, look it up and be sure you want to eat it. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods are always best. Processed foods often add unneeded preservatives, salt, and sugar. Choose real foods (like eggs, lean meats, fresh fruits and veggies, and whole grain breads) over processed foods with added ingredients you don't need or understand. 4.Choose the right fat. Use heart-healthy fats such as canola and olive oil whenever you can. Butter is a real food but margarine isn't. Fats are good for you-just choose the right ones. And be a bit creative when you can such as using avocado on your toast instead of butter and jelly. 5.Don't forget to snack. Having a healthy snack between meals can help you not to overeat when mealtime comes around. 6.Treat yourself and enjoy. There is always room for a treat. Dark chocolate is everyone's friend. The oatmeal in an oatmeal cookie is good for your cholesterol. 7.Watch the calories. The USDA says that most adults need about 2000 calories a day. Make it Happy One of the best pleasures of life is sitting around the table with family and friends to enjoy a good meal. Here are some tips for making meal time a happy one. 1.Presentation of food-colors, plates, etc. 2.Turn off the devices and have some fun table talk. Make it Homemade 1.Preparing a meal together is a great family experience for any age. Even the little ones can help stir and add ingredients and feel a part of the meal prep that is so much fun. 2.Eating at home ensures that you know where the ingredients came from and that it is fresh and good. Plus you'll save money!",

How can people manage or self-regulate their own inner states? How can sport and exercise psychology professionals help people manage their inner states? Is sport psychology just a placebo effect? Taking an applied perspective that bridges the gap between sport and exercise, the book answers these questions by covering the key topics in the field, including confidence, anxiety, self-regulation, stress and self-esteem. There are also chapters on the role of music in performance, imagery and exercise addiction. Each chapter is written by an expert in that field, and includes a range of features illustrating specific issues, either within the research literature or their practical application. This is a comprehensive and engaging overview of an evolving discipline, and will be essential reading to any student of sport and exercise psychology. It will also be of huge interest to athletes and coaches seeking an accessible understanding of the role of psychology in sport.",

          "author":"Susan A Jackson",
          "description":"The experience of flow is still one of the least understood phenomena in sport. And yet it is one of the richest, most memorable experiences an athlete will ever know. Some call it a natural high. Others refer to it as being in a zone. Whatever it's called, flow is an elusive and very sought-after psychological state that athletes, coaches, and sport psychologists have tried to understand, harness, and employ to their benefit since Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi first coined the term back in the early 1970s. Now, in the first book devoted exclusively to flow in sports, the pioneering legend Csikszentmihalyi and sport psychology researcher Susan Jackson attempt not only to explain the phenomenon but also to identify the key conditions associated with its occurrence. The book begins with a description of what flow is and is not. Flow is defined as a person's total absorption into an activity. While it is always a peak, satisfying experience, it is not necessarily associated with peak performance on every occasion. Most of the book delves deeply into the key factors leading up to and accompanying the flow experience. The authors also recommend certain actions on the part of the athlete or coach to optimize the conditions in training and performance that allow flow to occur. The book is full of vivid examples, captivating quotes, and revealing research findings that enhance the authors' clear and insightful text. The sport setting is rife with opportunities to experience flow-be it in pick-up games or the Olympics. But until now, flow has been an infrequent, accidental, and even mysterious phenomenon to most athletes. With Flow in Sports , this optimal experience becomes both more familiar and more achievable. Get to know flow, and get into it. Find out what you've been missing.",
