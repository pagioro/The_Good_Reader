## **Manual Testing**

### Header

#### Navigation Bar (Nav-Bar)

* Expected Outcome: The navigation bar should be visible on every site page. The navigation bar should toggle if the page is rendered on smaller screens for a better user experience. 
* Test: Visit every site page to check if the navigation bar is visible. View the navigation bar on different size screens to check the responsiveness of the navigation bar and toggle function. 
* Result: The navigation bar is visible on every site page. The links are toggled for a better user experience when viewed on smaller screens. 
* Verdict: Code functions as intended.

#### Logo

* Expected Outcome: When clicking the logo, the user should be redirected to the home page.
* Test: I tried clicking the logo from all different site pages as a logged-in user or not. 
* Result: Whenever I clicked the logo, I was redirected to the home page.
* Verdict: Code functions as intended.

#### Home Link

* Expected Outcome: The user should be redirected to the Home page when clicking the Home link.
* Test: I tried clicking the Home link from all different pages on the site, both as a logged-in user and not.
* Result: Whenever I clicked the Home link, I was redirected to the home page. 
* Verdict: Code functions as intended.
