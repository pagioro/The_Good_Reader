## **Manual Testing**

### Header

#### Navigation Bar (Nav-Bar)

* Expected Outcome: The navigation bar should be visible on every site page. The navigation bar should toggle if the page is rendered on smaller screens for a better user experience. 
* Test: Visit every site page to check if the navigation bar is visible. View the navigation bar on different size screens to check the responsiveness of the navigation bar and toggle function. 
* Result: The navigation bar is visible on every site page. The links are toggled for a better user experience when viewed on smaller screens. 
* Verdict: Code functions as intended.
