### **Business Plan**

E-commerce has been growing increasingly, and when the pandemic hit, the potential of this up-and-coming market became apparent.
During and after the incident, companies changed their strategies, making people work from home with more flexible hours, and a good part of their purchases was and are made over the internet.
The business model for The Good Reader store is B2C (Business to Consumer) which is selling directly to the end customer.
Customers can call or send an email for help with products they've already purchased.
