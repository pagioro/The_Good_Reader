    # **The Good Reader**

## **Introduction**

The Good Reader is a website where you can buy books and have them delivered to your home! The Good Reader offers all kinds of books. Users can create their own profiles so that their shipping and billing information is saved. As a customer you can also see your previous orders and update or delete your profile. Orders over 20$ have free delivery and users can easily see when they have reached the free shipping limit. Products can be added to the cart and can be purchased using card payment. Order confirmation is sent to the email address provided by the customer. Users can also stay updated with all the latest and exclusive offers by following The Good Reader's Facebook page and by subscribing to the monthly newsletter.

### **Business Plan**

E-commerce has been growing increasingly, and when the pandemic hit, the potential of this up-and-coming market became apparent.
During and after the incident, companies changed their strategies, making people work from home with more flexible hours, and a good part of their purchases was and are made over the internet.
The business model for The Good Reader store is B2C (Business to Consumer) which is selling directly to the end customer.
Customers can call or send an email for help with products they've already purchased.

### **Planning Stage**

The initial step in this project was to create a general visual idea of how the page should look. I decided to make the most common resources on a bookstore website that were presented and placed in conventional places on the page; for example, the search bar should be at the top, always easy to find.
In the beginning, I also created wireframes for the website to get a better idea of what I intended. I also made all my user stories to ensure I applied all the functionality I wanted.

### **Project Goals**

The app is designed as an e-commerce application that encourages users to make purchases. My goal for this project was to create a user-friendly site for people who want to buy books online by offering a neat place to navigate and make purchases.

### **Design Goals**

On the presentation page of the site was included a photo of a boy reading a book to draw attention, the buttons just above with all the functionalities and easy to understand. 
Was added a white background on the pages where the books are showing to make them stand out.
It was also important that the site looked and worked well on all devices, regardless of screen size.

### **Design Choices**

* Font

To stay in line with the goal of presenting a clean and sophisticated website, I chose an elegant font called Roboto for easy reading.

* Color Scheme

To keep the site visually appealing, I gave the header and footer a lighter background with a beige and green tint, and I gave the logo a black colour. In addition to these colours, I chose to keep the background white and the text black on some pages.

- Green: #70c8b5
- Gray: #D6E4E5
- Dark blue: #00205b
- Light beige: #F8EDE3
- White: #fff
- Black: #000

## **Wireframes**

Site moc-ups were designed using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). Since the site is built to be fully responsive one of the design goals was that the user should recognize the different pages and sections of the page no matter what size they were using. 

**Front Page**

The front page is designed to give the user an instant understanding of the page's purpose.
